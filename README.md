# Fitness-Dashboard
🚀 Just Finished Building a Fitness Dashboard in Power BI! 💪 <br>
I'm excited to share this interactive Fitness Dashboard I created using Microsoft Power BI! 📊✨<br>
<br>
📊 Highlights:<br>
Membership trends (Active vs Expired) <br>
Revenue, Expenses & Profit tracking 💰<br>
Client progress with % performance bar 📈<br>
Monthly member insights 📅<br>
<br>
Power BI + DAX = My workout combo for data storytelling 🚀<br>
<br>
💡 Why this matters: <br>
This dashboard empowers gym owners and managers to track performance, improve member retention, and drive profitability through clear, data-driven insights.<br>
I’d love to hear your thoughts — 👉 What other KPIs would you include for gyms and fitness centers?<br>
<br>

To present complex weather and environmental data in a visually clear and interactive format that can be understood at a glance.<br>
<br>
🛠️ Tools & Skills Used:<br>
